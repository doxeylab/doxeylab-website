# Biology as a Data Science

The Doxey lab is a bioinformatics research lab at the University of Waterloo located in the Department of Biology. Some members are also cross-affiliated to the Cheriton School of Computer Science. We develop and use <bf>computational</bf> approaches to analyze and compare genomes, and we apply <bf>experimental</bf> approaches to characterize new gene families and functions that we predict from data. Our work spans several fields including: pathogen biology, gene/protein function prediction, evolutionary genomics, and omics analysis of human disease.

We are fortunate to work with numerous research groups around the world, and we are always looking for new collaborations. Don't hesitate to contact us!
