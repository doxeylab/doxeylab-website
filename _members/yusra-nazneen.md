Yusra is a PhD student in the Doxey Lab, co-supervised by Dr. Trevor Charles. She completed her B.Sc. in Honours Life Sciences at McMaster University and her M.Sc. in Biology with a specialization in Bioinformatics at McGill University. She also gained experience at the National Research Council of Canada as part of the Molecular Modeling Team, where she worked on developing an AI system to predict protein–protein interactions. Her master’s research focused on identifying novel intrinsically disordered and prion-like regions in eukaryotes and exploring their functional relevance. For her PhD, she is investigating novel mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance using computational approaches.
