He received his bachelor's degree in Information Systems in 2025 at Stony Brook University, where he co-led the 2024 SBU iGEM Team's development of a microRNA-based B-cell lymphoma diagnostic and investigated the influence of protein structure on amino acid substitution under Dr. Joshua Rest. Manny is interested in understanding the development and spread of both antimicrobial resistance and cancers.
